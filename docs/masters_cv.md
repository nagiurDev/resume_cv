## Research Projects - `Doing`

- Work with `Algaradi`

<!-- - An NER Dataset with Entity Relationships for the South Asian Business and Economy Context
    - Applying NLP techniques to develop a richly annotated NER dataset focused on the South Asian business and economy domain. This project involves designing an annotation schema, building a taxonomy, collecting and pre-processing text data, performing annotation using quality control procedures, and training/evaluating state-of-the-art NER models.
   Keyword: NER, RE, Corpus
    - Currently focusing on `data collection and Corpus Development`.

    - Expected to complete the dataset and model evaluation by [May 2025] `On going`. -->

- Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models for Writing Improvement

  - October 2024 - Decembar 2024

  - Developed a multi-task NLP pipeline addressing grammatical acceptability (CoLA), correction (Lang-8), sentiment analysis (SST-2), and emotion detection (GoEmotions). Utilized and fine-tuned RoBERTa (base) for acceptability, sentiment, and emotion, and FLAN-T5 (base) for correction.
  - Faced challenges in optimizing the pipeline for multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. Observed that improvements in one task sometimes led to performance degradation in others, indicating complex interactions between the different components.
  - **Key achievements**: Balancing task-specific optimization with overall pipeline performance in multi-task learning requires careful consideration of training strategies, data balancing, and objective function design. This research provides a foundation for future work exploring more sophisticated training methodologies for such integrated NLP systems.

## Professional Engagements - `Done`

- Data Analyst Intern, Peoples Softech, Gazipur, Dhaka

  - Remote
  - November 2024 - On going
